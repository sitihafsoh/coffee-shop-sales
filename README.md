## Background
Maven Roasters is a coffee shop chain with three locations in New York City: Astoria, Hell’s Kitchen, and Lower Manhattan. We offer a wide variety of products across nine categories, including coffee, tea, drinking chocolate, bakery items, flavors, loose tea, coffee beans, packaged chocolate, and branded merchandise.

## Stakeholder
1. Maven Roasters’s Franchise Owner
2. Operations & Branch Management Division

## Problem Statement
The analysis seeks to identify and understand patterns in revenue and transaction fluctuations over time, pinpointing any periods of decline. It also aims to uncover performance disparities among branches, determine unique customer behavior patterns by day and hour, and identify both underperforming and top-selling product categories to optimize overall business operations.

## Objectives
1. To better understand purchase behavior and streamline operations using collected transactional data from Jan-Jun 2023.​
2. To transform the data into a dynamic dashboard that franchise owners can use to identify patterns, trends and opportunities for the business.

## Tools
Microsoft Excel 365 & Tableau

## Conclusions
1. General Performance and Trends: 
  - The business experienced a general revenue and transaction dip in February, but strongly recovered and grew through June across all branches.
  - Morning hours (6-10 am) are the busiest across all branches.
2. Branch-Specific Observations: 
  - Lower Manhattan consistently underperforms compared to Astoria and Hell's Kitchen, exhibiting the lowest revenue and transaction volumes, and earlier decline in daily transactions.
  - Each branch has unique peak transaction days: Astoria (Mon, Wed, Thurs, Fri), Hell's Kitchen (Tue, Thurs, Fri, Sun), and Lower Manhattan (Mon, Thurs, Fri)
3. Product Performance: 
  - Coffee, Tea, Bakery, Drinking Chocolate, and Flavours are the most popular product categories.
  - A similar pattern in product preference is observed across all branches, with Brewed Chai Tea, Gourmet Brewed Coffee, and Barista Espresso being top performers.
  - The product that not listed in the tables (see the slide of presentation) have very low sales.

## Recommendations
1. Revenue & Transactions 
  - Investigate February Dip: Determine the cause of the February decline in revenue and transactions across all branches. Was it due to seasonality, a specific event, or other factors?
  - Optimize Lower Manhattan: Analyze why Lower Manhattan consistently underperforms. Is it location, competition, or a different customer base? Implement targeted strategies to boost revenue and transactions at this branch. 
  - Leverage Morning Peak: Since 6-10 am is the busiest time, consider strategies to maximize revenue during this period, such as: 
    - Promoting breakfast combos or special offers
    - Ensuring adequate staffing and quick service 
  - Smooth out daily transactions in Lower Manhattan Branch: Consider making promotion or discount in the quiet days for Lower Manhattan
2. Product Strategy 
  - Promote Top Sellers: Continue to focus on promoting Coffee, Tea, and Bakery items, as they are the most popular. Consider expanding the offerings within these categories.
  - Evaluate Underperforming Categories: Analyze why some underperforming products have low sales. Consider: 
    - Repositioning or rebranding these products
    - Changing the pricing strategy
    - Discontinuing them if they are not profitable 
  - Optimize Product Mix: Since the top 15 products in each branch (Astoria, Hell's Kitchen, and Lower Manhattan) drive the majority of sales, ensure these items are always well-stocked and prominently displayed.
3. Branch-Specific Strategies
  - Astoria: Capitalize on high activity on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  - Hell's Kitchen: Focus on maintaining momentum on Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Sunday.
  - Lower Manhattan: Develop strategies to increase customer traffic on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays, which are currently quieter.
